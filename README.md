# Documentation

## Overview

Baccaratio is a comprehensive web application that combines a backend built with Spring Boot 3.2.4 and a front-end developed using Angular 17.3.1. The primary purpose of Baccaratio is to provide a simulated environment for the popular casino game Baccarat, allowing players to place bets, participate in rounds, and monitor their chip balances. The backend is RESTful, ensuring seamless integration with various front-end applications.

## Availability

Baccaratio is also available for demonstration purposes at [https://baccaratio.porkolab.hu/](https://baccaratio.porkolab.hu/), where users can experience the functionality and features of the application firsthand. ***Please be patient, because the backend of the application needs to 'wake up', and the first responses may be slower than normal.***

## Gameplay Mechanics

In the game of Baccarat, players engage in the following gameplay mechanics:

1.  **Betting Options**:
    
    -   Players can place bets on three outcomes: "player," "banker," or a "tie." Additionally, special betting options may be available for more diverse gameplay.
2.  **Card Dealing**:
    
    -   After players place their bets, the virtual "croupier" initiates the card dealing process.
    -   Cards are dealt to both the player and the banker according to standard Baccarat rules.
3.  **Outcome Determination**:
    
    -   The outcome of the game is determined by comparing the total points of the player's and banker's hands.
    -   The goal is to achieve a total as close to 9 as possible without exceeding it.
4.  **Result Display**:
    
    -   After the cards are dealt, the winning outcome is displayed to the player through an alert within a 5-second window.
5.  **Payouts**:
    
    -   Winning bets are collected at the end of the round and added to the player's chip count.
    -   The amount won depends on the type of bet placed and the corresponding payout ratio.

By following these gameplay mechanics, players can enjoy the excitement and anticipation of Baccarat as they strategize their bets and await the outcome of each round.

## Player Management

Players start with an initial chip count. Bets are deducted at the start of a round, and winnings are added to the player's chip count at the end of the round, according to the outcome and type of bet placed. The maximum bet that one can bet is 100 dollars.

### Baccarat Rules

Baccarat is a popular card game played at casinos worldwide. The game is simple to learn and offers exciting betting opportunities. Here are the basic rules of Baccarat:

1.  **Objective**: The objective of Baccarat is to bet on the hand that will have a total value closest to 9.
    
2.  **Card Values**:
    
    -   Aces count as 1 point.
    -   Cards 2 through 9 retain their face value.
    -   10s and face cards (King, Queen, Jack) count as 0 points.
3.  **Game Setup**:
    
    -   Baccarat is typically played with 6 to 8 decks of cards.
    -   Each round begins with players placing their bets on either the "Player," "Banker," or "Tie" outcome.
4.  **Dealing Cards**:
    
    -   The dealer deals two cards each to the "Player" and "Banker" hands.
    -   If either hand has a total value of 8 or 9 from the first two cards (known as a "natural"), no further cards are drawn.
5.  **Drawing Additional Cards**:
    
    -   If the total value of either hand is less than 8 or 9, additional cards may be drawn according to specific rules:
        -   If the Player's total is 5 or less, the Player draws another card. Otherwise, the Player stands.
        -   If the Player stands, the Banker draws a card if their total is 5 or less.
        -   If the Banker's total is 2 or less, they always draw a card.
        -   If the Banker's total is 3, they draw a third card unless the Player's third card is an 8.
        -   If the Banker's total is 4, they draw a third card unless the Player's third card is a 0, 1, 8, or 9.
        -   If the Banker's total is 5, they draw a third card if the Player's third card is a 4, 5, 6, or 7.
        -   If the Banker's total is 6, they draw a third card if the Player's third card is a 6 or 7.
6.  **Determining the Winner**:
    
    -   The hand with a total value closest to 9 wins.
    -   If both hands have the same total, it's a tie.
7.  **Payouts**:
    
    -   Bets on the "Player" hand win even money (1:1).
    -   Bets on the "Banker" hand win even money, but a 5% commission is typically charged on winning bets.
    -   Bets on a "Tie" typically offer higher payouts (usually 8:1 or 9:1), but it's less common due to the higher house edge.

These are the fundamental rules of Baccarat, providing players with an enjoyable and straightforward gaming experience.
